# Opening Data, Jittering 
Goal: 

1. Juypyter notebook and server
2. Download and store data (csv, shapefile)
- look into efficiency of storing, runtime, etc. and combining the tables 
3. Join datasets based on identifiers
4. Set up ways for sampling and aggregated data sets
- research for best
5. Data jittering 
- By surrogates, we mean files that are jittered, aggregated, or obscured enough to have a reasonable level of privacy; files that are true national samples that are random, but also samples that follow other established methodologies.
6. 

# Making data more Attainable 
Goal: Website where users can use simple input identifiers to sample data. Get specific state, or joins, and return anonomized results, graphs, tables, percentages, statistical stuff -> point to where to focus elections and all. 

1. Create Website hosted on github
2. Page for juypter code
3. Home page with search bars 
- also have data visualization 
4. Efficiency and Accuracy page

# Niche Topics to StandOut
