- Python
- ArcGIS REST API -> interactive mapping system from the extracted, sample, aggregated and queried data. 
- React 
- Git

# Opening Data, Jittering 
Goal: 

1. Juypyter notebook and server
2. Download and store data (csv, shapefile)
- look into efficiency of storing, runtime, etc. and combining the tables 
- Drop columns with NaN values above a certain threshold (~95%)
- Drop columns that have personal information 
3. Join datasets based on identifiers
4. Set up ways for sampling and aggregated data sets
- research for best
5. Data jittering 
- By surrogates, we mean files that are jittered, aggregated, or obscured enough to have a reasonable level of privacy; files that are true national samples that are random, but also samples that follow other established methodologies.

# Making data more Attainable 
Goal: Website where users can use simple input identifiers to sample data. Get specific state, or joins, and return anonomized results, graphs, tables, percentages, statistical stuff -> point to where to focus elections and all. 

1. Create Website hosted on github
2. Page for juypter code
3. Home page with search bars 
- also have data visualization 
4. Efficiency and Accuracy page

# Niche Topics to StandOut
1. PCA to help users understand what factors affect certian outcome the most
- need to convert categorical data into numeric data
  - Need to figure out what columns are categorical
